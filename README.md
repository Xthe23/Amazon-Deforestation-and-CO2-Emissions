# Project 1

Repository for Project 1, focusing on the analysis of Brazil’s deforestation, CO2 emissions, and fire outbreaks to determine potential correlations.

## Brazil’s Deforestation, CO2 Emissions, and Fire Outbreaks

The purpose of this project is to explore the relationships between deforestation, CO2 emissions, and fire outbreaks in Brazil. We have compiled data from various sources and conducted statistical analyses to answer our research questions. The conclusions drawn from this study will be based on the insights gained from the data.

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis:** Deforestation does not correlate with both CO2 emissions and the fire outbreaks.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** Deforestation correlates with one or both of the factors - CO2 emissions or the fire outbreaks.

## Dataset Link

Data for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle:
[Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Degradation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation)

## Datasets Used

- `def_area_2004_2019.csv`: Deforestation area data from 2004 to 2019.
- `inpe_brazilian_amazon_fires_1999_2019.csv`: Fire incidents data from 1999 to 2019.

## World Data Bank Python Module

Data was also correlated with the World Data Bank's data using the wbdata python module:

## Analysis Questions

### 1. Relationship Between Deforestation and Fire Incidents in Brazil

Is there a correlation between the amount of fire outbreaks and deforestation?

### 2. Fire Incidents and CO2 Emissions in Brazil

Is there a correlation between the amount of fire outbreaks in the forest and the CO2 Emissions as well?

### 3. Area of Deforestation vs CO2 Emissions in Brazil

What is the correlation between Deforestation and CO2 Emissions within Brazil?

### 4. CO2 Emissions of Brazil Compared to Neighboring Countries

Is there a correlation between Brazil's CO2 emissions and Brazil’s neighboring countries CO2 emissions?
